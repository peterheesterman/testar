# Todos: 

## This iteration

 - [done] make the test file have an import of the folder name that you are testing index from or the name of the file as an import
 - ---> Chalk it all up so that it looks nice 
 - Make the testing framework optionally setable (with a env variable)
 - Document the different uses


## Phase 1:
 - Add a `testar learn` function that tells you tips and tricks about testing
 - Dogfood the functions on all the file to put some tests in.
 - Make it write meaningful tests
 - Make it detect the types in the function handle
 - Add and use flow
 - Make it so that it can store config in a .testar file in home directory
 - Make the testing framework optionally setable (with a .testar in home directory and a testar init function)

## Phase 2:
 - Add anaylitics of functions already in file
 - Make it use async await everywhere
 - Transpile it so that it can be used anywhere
